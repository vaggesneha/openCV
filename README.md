# openCV

OpenCV is the huge open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in todayâ€™s systems. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even handwriting of a human.

The main application of OpenCV are follows :-

1. Changing Colorspaces: Learn to change images between different color spaces. Plus learn to track a colored object in a video.

2. Geometric Transformations of Images: Learn to apply different geometric transformations to images like rotation, translation etc.

3. Image Thresholding: Learn to convert images to binary images using global thresholding, Adaptive thresholding, Otsu's binarization etc

4. Smoothing Images: Learn to blur the images, filter the images with custom kernels etc.

5. Morphological Transformations: Learn about morphological transformations like Erosion, Dilation, Opening, Closing etc

6. Image Gradients: Learn to find image gradients, edges etc.

7. Canny Edge Detection: Learn to find edges with Canny Edge Detection(Edge detection techniques: Sobel,Laplacian,Canny)

8. Image Pyramids: Learn about image pyramids and how to use them for image blending

9. Contours in OpenCV: All about Contours in OpenCV

10. Histograms in OpenCV: All about histograms in OpenCV

11. Image Transforms in OpenCV: Meet different Image Transforms in OpenCV like Fourier Transform, Cosine Transform etc.

12. Template Matching: Learn to search for an object in an image using Template Matching

13. Hough Line Transform: Learn to detect lines in an image

14. Hough Circle Transform: Learn to detect circles in an image

15. Image Segmentation with Watershed Algorithm: Learn to segment images with watershed segmentation

16. Interactive Foreground Extraction using GrabCut Algorithm: Learn to extract foreground with GrabCut algorithm
