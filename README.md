# openCV

OpenCV is the huge open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in todayâ€™s systems. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even handwriting of a human.

The main application of OpenCV are follows :-

Changing Colorspaces: Learn to change images between different color spaces. Plus learn to track a colored object in a video.

Geometric Transformations of Images: Learn to apply different geometric transformations to images like rotation, translation etc.

Image Thresholding: Learn to convert images to binary images using global thresholding, Adaptive thresholding, Otsu's binarization etc

Smoothing Images: Learn to blur the images, filter the images with custom kernels etc.

Morphological Transformations: Learn about morphological transformations like Erosion, Dilation, Opening, Closing etc

Image Gradients: Learn to find image gradients, edges etc.

Canny Edge Detection: Learn to find edges with Canny Edge Detection

Image Pyramids: Learn about image pyramids and how to use them for image blending

Contours in OpenCV: All about Contours in OpenCV

Histograms in OpenCV: All about histograms in OpenCV

Image Transforms in OpenCV: Meet different Image Transforms in OpenCV like Fourier Transform, Cosine Transform etc.

Template Matching: Learn to search for an object in an image using Template Matching

Hough Line Transform: Learn to detect lines in an image

Hough Circle Transform: Learn to detect circles in an image

Image Segmentation with Watershed Algorithm: Learn to segment images with watershed segmentation

Interactive Foreground Extraction using GrabCut Algorithm: Learn to extract foreground with GrabCut algorithm
